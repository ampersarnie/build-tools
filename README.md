# Build Tools
The Build Tools aim to cater for various needs of the Big Bite team when creating new sites, plugins and themes for projects. This means we need to have a tooling structure that allows us to develop in isolation when building a plugin or theme along side a whole site project without having to switch or configure tooling for when we change contexts. This package contains everything the tooling needs as well as the relevant webpack configuration to meet these needs.

# Setup
Add the package using the git url and version:

```bash
npm i -D @bigbite/build-tools
```
